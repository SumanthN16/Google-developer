Clean Everywhere

Clean everywhere is the project is what we come across to solve the GDSC problem 6 "Clean water and sanitization".

The problem:- 
Now a days we find the water bodies to be too polluted and unhygiene has we pollute the bank of river and pounds.
River water used to be the main source of water supply in past which was been used by many creature and it was pure to use.
So my plan is to preserve the clean river water untill the end of the river and make the river water avalable for people everywhere the water flows adn also stays.
This does stop only near river placeses but also extends to the placeses where the river isnt found.

The Solution:-
We have to first Clean the water bodies to get the pure water supply.
So how we do it? Our Idea is to create a application throught which a common people can excess it.
this application will have a camera in its first page. when the person finds any kind of polution he can take a pic of it and upload on the app.
This app will scan the image and recougnise what type of pollution is clicked in the image and icon based on it will be selected and tagged to the image and the
image is taged to the location at which the person had taken the pic. from this we can recognise the spot from which the polution is started and this can be elemented imdeateley by the respodible person in that area.
this also has a dynamic nature. If the same image is clicked by different people from the same position the back groud of teh image turns into white to red making it visible and saying the people this place is been spotted has dirty place adn many people is being disturbed due to it.
by this we collect data and this data is visible to everyone. from which people world that place can notice it and do the required action and clean that place.
similarly if we are able to clean all th eplaces and also avoid the chemical delevry into th erivers from the factories and save our water bodies has will has our land has will.
If the polution is in the large area the circle taged gets larger.

Conclusion :- we can reduse the waste and stop the water getting polluted and allowing many people to use that water for driving and satitazation.
